# Poke that Pokemon - An Inventory Application

- First of all, let's address the ass UI of this project, I mean I could've done better ofc but this is supposed to be a backend project, not frontend one, so why bother lol
- Liked the project, but it was very repetitive, thus it took me longer to finish it
- Fun tho, liked Postgres, but I seriously hate deploying dude, there always appear an annoying error
- Ik this is supposed to be a serious documentation, but I dont feel like making one right now, so I'mma do this only for now
- Used Render to deploy btw
